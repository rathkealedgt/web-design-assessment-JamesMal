                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Woodworking, the forming or shaping of wood to create, restore,
                        or repair useful or decorative objects.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Carpentry, joinery, and cabinetmaking are specialized woodworking crafts,
                        providing a range of products from wooden structures and furniture to wooden toys.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Historical Background</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The unique characteristics of wood have made it a basic material
                        for housing, furniture, tools, vehicles, and a multitude of other
                        products throughout history. Woodworking, in fact, was one of humankind's
                        first skills. From the wood clubs and spears at the start of civilization,
                        the use of wood was extended to dugout canoes, farm plows, and simple three-legged
                        stools, to the ornate cabinetry and intricate structures of modern times.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The reduction of forest reserves since the Middle Ages, however, made
                        timber increasingly expensive. This has brought about greater reliance by
                        the construction and manufacturing industries, in modern times, on such composite
                        wood products as plywood, chipboard, and fiberboard. These new materials are stable
                        and do not swell or shrink as readily as natural lumber. They do not require long
                        seasoning periods, and they can be waterproofed, fireproofed, and impregnated with
                        protective chemicals. Plywood is particularly valuable to carpenters because it allows
                        them to cover broad areas of framing in a short time.
